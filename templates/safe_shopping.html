            Your Security

            How do we protect your Data?

            We use state-of-the-art encryption technology to protect your credit card/personal information. You can place your order(s) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

            Digital certificates encrypt data using SSL technology, which is the industry-standard method for protecting Web communications. The SSL security protocol provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity and optional client authentication for a TCP/IP connection. Because SSL is built into all major browsers and Web servers, simply installing a digital certificate turns on their SSL capabilities.

            SSL comes in two strengths, 40-bit and 128-bit, which refer to the length of the "session key"; generated by every encrypted transaction. The longer the key, the more difficult it is to break the encryption code. We use 128-bit encryption. Most browsers support 128-bit SSL sessions, which is trillions of times stronger than 40-bit sessions.

            Who are CyberSource?

            We have chosen CyberSource as a partner for its secure server software. They are a leading payment system provider to online businesses. For further information about CyberSource please visit their web site at https://cybersource.com. The CyberSource software sits behind a corporate firewall. Access to this machine is strictly controlled, preventing unauthorized access to your personal data. Once you have passed your Credit Card details to us, they are stored on the CyberSource server in an encrypted format.

            Is the transaction Real-Time?

            All Credit Card transactions are completed in real-time. After you have confirmed your order, we make an immediate connection to our payment service providers to verify the card and amount, so that authorization is given before we complete the order. All shirts with customisation will be fully charged once you have confirmed your order and it has been accepted by us a binding contract will exist between us at the time of dispatch of the goods from our warehouse.

            Do you check for fraudulent cards?

            When we receive your Credit Card details, an on-line check of your Credit Card is conducted with their Acquiring bankers. This process ensures the number you entered actually corresponds to a real credit card number and is not a bogus card. The CyberSource system also checks various "Hot Card lists" to ensure that no fraudulent use is being made of any Credit Card. This on-line verification of your details is carried out over a secure line to the bank. Credit Card data is, at no time, sent over the Internet using the validation process. We also carry out random security checks on cards to ensure we help prevent fraud - please note that we do not intend any personal slight if your card is chosen for a random check.

            What else can I do to ensure my details remain safe?

            The second way to ensure you have a secure connection is to look for either the GlobalSign logo or RSA Data Security logo and only purchase from merchants you know and trust. Here again, the digital certificate is important. In addition to encrypting the data you send over the Internet, the certificate can be used to confirm and authenticate the identity of a web site's owner (in this case, the merchant). Because digital certificates act as electronic signatures they cannot be forged, you can be certain the connection is secure if either RSA DATA SECURITY INC. or GlobalSign Inc. has issued the certificate. 

            Who are GlobalSign?

            GlobalSign, Inc. is a leading provider of digital authentication services and products for electronic commerce and other forms of secure communications. For more information on GlobalSign please visit their web site at https://www.globalsign.com.
